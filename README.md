# The-impact-of-AI-on-Job-markets

In this project, I analyzed the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on job markets by addressing 10 key questions based on a dataset. The analysis explores various aspects of how AI adoption is influencing employment trends, job creation, skill requirements, and industry shifts.

Using **Excel** for data analysis and **PowerPoint** for presentation, I created a detailed report that provides insights into the evolving relationship between AI and the workforce. Each question in the dataset was carefully analyzed to highlight key patterns and trends, offering a comprehensive view of AI's role in shaping the future of jobs and industries. 

The project provides valuable insights for stakeholders, helping them understand how AI is expected to disrupt traditional job markets and the skills that will be in demand in the future.
